## When it stops working again after OSX update

Edit the file /etc/zshrc adding the following lines in the end:

```bash
# Nix
if [ -e '/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh' ]; then
  . '/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh'
fi
# End Nix
```

## Nix and Github

Nix downloads packages from Github and you may quickly get rate limited by Github.
For that not to happen, generate a token in Github and add it to nix.conf file as:

```
access-tokens = github.com=<your_access_token>
```

## Nix fetchFromGithub: how to figure out SHA256 hash of a revision

If you have access to `lib`, then set `sha256 = lib.fakeHash`, run the build, check the error message, it'd show the real hash value which you can then take and set.

Otherwie you may use nix-prefetch with fetchFromGithub command specifying the repository details, as shown down below:

```
nix-prefetch fetchFromGitHub --owner catppuccin --repo alacritty --rev main
The fetcher will be called as follows:
> fetchFromGitHub {
>   owner = "catppuccin";
>   repo = "alacritty";
>   rev = "main";
>   sha256 = "sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
> }

## Configure programs with home manager

Most of the packages have home-manager support, for example \
wezterm has this page that tells what options you have to configure it: \
