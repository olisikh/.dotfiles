## TODO:
1. Make a script that makes a dummy shell.nix file so I don't have to remember or look for boilerplate

## Maybe:
1. Wrap home-manager configuration with nix-darwin to set my preferred OSX configurations for finder, hotkeys, etc.
1. Install GUI apps such as Amethyst, Obsidian, etc using homebrew-nix.
